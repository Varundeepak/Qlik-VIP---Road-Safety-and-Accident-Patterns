# Qlik VIP - Road Safety and Accident Patterns in India
## Project Description
This project aims to analyze road safety and accident patterns in India using the available data. By using advanced data visualization techniques in Qlik Sense, we try to find valuable insights into the causes, severity and other cases of road accidents across the country. This analysis will look into the impact of accidents on various road users, examine the influence of factors like weather conditions and identify high-risk regions. Through interactive and visually attractive dashboards, the project aims to provide a data-driven understanding of the road safety situation in India.

You can use any of these two links to view the Project Demonstration Video. The video file is around 2 GB so in case Google Drive asks you to download the video, use the YouTube link instead if it is easier for you.

## Note
While exporting the sheets as PDF, the Variable Inputs are not displayed in the PDF, understandably because once we download the sheets as PDF, we cannot interact with them, so showing the Variable Input areas in the exported PDF would not make sense. But they are shown in the Project Documentation and the Explanation Video, so please refer to them.
